# Why America is Not For Everyone

A short opinion piece on why America is not for everyone. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've never been able to afford housing on my own, except for a brief year in Portland, Oregon, a studio apartment in the ghettos. I am in my early 30's, and I 
don't have nice things to say about how some things transpired. Ever since that one year in that studio apartment, the economy brought me to my knees. And I 
don't mean the kind of bringing to the knees that is to signal loyalty to a ruler. I mean the kind due to dishonest, deceptive, subversive and maybe even 
terroristic practices that break the backbones of businesses, neuters corporations, and sells the souls of its youth's potential. I will go in depth into what 
I mean by this ornate language. 

In Portland, Oregon, there were housing issues that affected people. During my college years, I had to seek housing off campus. A time period after I settled into 
a neighborhood close to the college campus, I'd say in around 2018, there was a vehicle vandalism spree that occurred in the neighborhood. When I drove to and from 
campus, there were patrolling unmarked vehicles that I suspected to be private investigators or something. They were tailing everyone that they thought were 
suspicious. It was clearly a situation fit for civil unrest. There were the same red vehicles that kept patrolling the neighborhood. Other vehicles were involved 
in that investigation and vandalism affair as well. But the red vehicles stuck out to me because red is a bright color, so I don't know for sure if those people 
were actually private investigators or not. But they sure drove flamboyant vehicles. I never found out what happened that caused all that damage in the neighborhood. 
And that's just the tip of the iceberg with Portland, Oregon. That was about enough for me. 

I don't want to talk about Portland, Oregon anymore. Every time I think about that place, I just think about how it was supposed to turn into Silicon Forest. That's 
what the press was saying when I first looked into college locations, back in high school. But the odds of that happening now, especially since all the protests 
that went on, as well as the decline of Intel Corporation, is about 10%, that deplorable number. The sucker I was back then... go to college, graduate at 22, get 
settled into industry by 25, then get married and own a home by this age. College proved to be very enthusiastic in utilizing barriers past the barrier to entry, 
which is exceptional high school scholastic work. Barriers included professors' politics and student politics. Politics can be disgusting. My college years were 
about as enjoyable as being a child that believes in Santa. The child grows up, looks back, and does not see the same things, and the nostalgia they feel may very well 
turn into an indignation at being force fed lies of an industrial scale but for poor industrial outcomes, hence fiascos such as the student debt crisis. 

A few days ago, I watched a short clip of the rapper Mac Miller, now deceased. In the video, Mac Miller was trash talking Donald Trump in about 2016-2017. Mac Miller 
was not that great of a rapper. I don't really like the genre of rap that much, but his mannerisms show a side of America that has been unaddressed for decades now, 
and still remains unaddressed. The fraternity and hedonism, the egos, and the blame game. Police suspected Mac Miller's drug dealer killed him. Mac Miller allegedly 
used hard drugs. 

I disdained fraternity after high school. I already figured, in my head and based on the cold affection I received from people I've crossed paths with, that everyone 
that has or had partaken would eventually turn into any other fink rat. Here's how I believe the police work with drugs and all, since drug use turns endemic. The police 
and fraternities get along. Police are also just as likely to be w**** f****** as any other person, based on the unofficial mental statistics I have. So police 
have to participate in all this vice, in order to uncover the vice. They might also have been the ones dealing the drugs in the first place. How do you figure someone 
that has only a phone as their most valuable possession would be able to score hard drugs? And these hard drugs are imported, not grown domestically, or manufactured 
in a factory. These drugs are also highly addictive and do not provide for much intellectual introspection. A haze of euphoric sleepiness, or short little spikes of 
thrilling exhilaration, based on the anecdotes I've read. But the drug business can pay a lot more than scholasticism. Scholasticism is as lame as it is intangible, 
in the minds of people seeking material pleasures and material wealth. So there were and continue to be these unknown channels of drug distribution. I figure someone 
heavily involved in it gets caught, they might even get killed for getting caught, and then the whole little pyramid crumbles. Then a "new player" shows up and does 
practically the same exact thing, but here's the catch...they struck a deal with the police, so they won't make the same mistakes as the last guy and they are 
confident they won't suffer the same fate as the last guy. 

Another issue that made me turn my back on fraternity was the constant bro-bro competition. Accusations of someone stealing from someone else. Suspicions and jealousies 
of that best friend hooking up with that hot friend. I counted myself out then, and I continue counting myself out now. I don't know why, but the social dynamics don't 
really change much if there is not good structure and cause for higher things. Some people just get older, become more repressive of their desires, and still act like immature 
spiteful teenagers underneath. Now I will mention how people, the social creatures that they are, actually do not have to be really smart or really attractive or really of 
anything as individuals to be successful. They could actually be a nobody, meaning the world wouldn't stop if they disappeared. They could be a mediocre person with a political 
spirit, those kinds of attitudes of win-backing and one-upmanship really go far depending on the calculation. Whereas rocket scientists want the rocket products to be able to 
actually launch, to have the capability to strike mobile targets and/or long-distance targets, those with political spirits can gain a dominating position by training their 
outward presentation and focusing on their objectives. A political person that just holds their tongue, says nice things, and it would help if they come from an old money 
upper-class family, and makes the right moves like a chess grandmaster would be able to achieve tens of times what a crazed populist murderer could. This is due to their 
positioning in the social structure, humanity's nature of doing things. Blaming some of the political people that have achieved high places turns into something like hating 
your heart. That would be moronic because they are supposed to be a central part of the society you live in. If you think your entire life should be in harmony, synchronization, 
and full identity with the society you live in, then you shouldn't hate leaders or people good at what they do. But if that is what a person thinks, they're probably a socialist 
in more than just a few areas, and there's nothing stopping them from feeling angry at select people. 

Mac Miller, a somewhat sad tale in the world of hip hop, a genre characterized by outspokenness and profanity and machismo through the audacity, driven by dysfunctional 
societies, depressing ironies, and violent new beginnings, made his mark as a rapper gone too soon practicing a musical genre that is not so elitist, but also not so for all
peoples either. 

Moving on past the hedonism, celebrated by the underworld and dressed up in gold and marriage ceremonies by above, there are also more deficits to American life. The 
media industry. Once 2016 hit, I noticed a decline in my media feeds. It wasn't solely because my media feeds were linking me to more alternative media. Public Broadcasting 
Corporation (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) were getting splintered underneath, and alternative media swept in to take its place on the internet, where most of the 
younger generation get their media from. The rise of alternative media meant that viewership was getting splintered into the old media and new media groups. And the alternative 
media, at least in the beginning since now it is competing with AI slop, fed into people's impulses and biases. Most are basic and rely heavily on pretty veneers. From the 
backend of those programmings, there was clearly effort to add more scientific technique to the arts of narration and storytelling. Provocative. Sensational. Modern and 
relatable with these tones intended to be marketed to certain masses of people. Viewership engineering. But despite how underfunded alternative media was, the fact is it 
cannot really maintain credibility on the same scale and detail as nationalized organizations. To clarify on what I mean by nationalized organizations, I am not referring 
to organizations such as Fox News (Republican) or Meta (global), often referred to as Facebook. I can only provide counter-examples, not examples on this term, 
"nationalization". Nationalization is a hefty subject, filled with these intricacies, and nationalization could really go wrong. So I don't blindly endorse nationalization 
efforts. Nationalization is very delicate with the time and circumstances. It is like a young beautiful woman that should have married a wealthy man, the only kind of men 
that can afford marriage in some cases, but the young beautiful woman chose not to, instead becoming a nun, and there goes her sex life. Chinese nationalists, for example, 
were defeated by Chinese communists shortly after the end of WWII. A lot of media women are not what they appear, I'll say that. In real life, less beautiful, more vulnerable, 
more insecure, more needy, more hungry for power and money from men. And I'd like to think that I'm not really misogynist. 

Institutions. Big countries such as the United States have their representatives publicly proclaim their love for institutions. Good American institutions mean better business. 
Better business means big business is more free from corruption. Underdeveloped countries also have a love for institutions since the populace becomes more organized and stuck 
within their realms, tribes maintaining alliances with each other by granting permission for the male of one tribe to marry the female of another, members of the same faith 
attending the same place of workplace, the farming clans reliably delivering products to the marketplace, those kinds of things that still occur in developed countries, but not 
as overt and culturally ceremonious in display. And there are more options in developed countries. Insurgent groups and anti-establishment power players have other notions of 
institutions. When institutions cannot deliver, for example, products cannot be made, labor is broken, and education becomes viewed more as brainwashing than improving the mind, 
those institutions get put up for opportunistic questions. And anti-establishment factions attempt to weaponize doubts of institutions and marshal beliefs in better things if matters 
were run by their hands. It all depends on the circumstances for who is better. Some anti-establishment mentalities only exist out of an appreciation for the foreign, doing the 
work of outreach for the foreign, and could very well be an equivalent substitute for an equally bad option, in cases where establishment institutions really do disappoint and 
betray. Where there is anti-establishment, there is friction and disappointment and setbacks as motive and not to mention, anger and vitriol channeled into causes framed as noble. 
Institutions constrain peoples' options. When the labor from those options fail to satisfy some people, there is a rejection of institutional authority. Reasons abound for why. 
Maybe someone is jealous and does not feel that their peer deserves that position at that institution, while they would be just a pawn if they were to join. Maybe the institution 
is waging political war, playing people against each other, separating families, and forcing labor. With that said, once some institutions go down under, there is no replacement 
that can be any different from their greatness without failing, except ones that emerge in a renewed and youthful similarity. It is during the downtime of transitioning from one 
institution to the next that competition abounds, of shameless tactics and careless but aggressive advances. But that energy always converges to a stasis. If the leaders were actually 
serious and honest in their efforts, there would be something that lasts. 

America is not for everyone because suffering exists in this country. Promises are rescinded, all part of the art of deals, in this country as much as in other countries. The 
difference is that American leadership intends for it to remain a developed country, or at least that is what I hope. Some Americans, born and raised in this country, cannot get ahead 
due to their mediocrity. Other Americans, no matter how excellent, are made to inevitably answer to those at the top, maybe the rich, maybe political representatives. 

I believe an important but seldomly spoken notion of political control, especially the kind that is to care for outliers and immigrants, is that it is better for some potential 
to go to waste rather than being used to forge new beginnings. Socialists in traditional societies believe this, many American ultra-conservatives believe this, and many immigrants 
believe this. But believing in this notion does not necessarily mean everyone can play by the same rules or co-exist with each other, just like that.  Migrants, from underdeveloped countries, 
have a different mentality to project. Well, at least the honest ones. Working hard. Not partaking in the black market, let alone be a major chess piece in it. Migrants from underdeveloped 
countries tend to have a more materialistic view to share, based on their communication with other people. I don't mean this in a disparaging way. My grandfather had that 
viewpoint because he came to the United States and worked manual labor for the rest of his life. So in his mind, hard work always equates to getting paid, and getting paid with 
money was the only way to feed his family. But I will add in some more of my notions on immigrants, the ones that labor. There is a primal mentality they carry with them, in order 
to relate to Americans from other walks of life. Keeping matters basic. Hard work, satisfiable housing, enough money to pay the bills. But immigrant politics are also deeply 
important to a country such as the United States, no matter if they are a laborer or a businessperson with strong foreign business ties. Maintaining cultural legacy. Being 
compliant with what they ask, their demands, in other words. And the immigrants that join academia and the educated sectors are really something else. They offer more talents and 
differing ideas, is what I'm saying. For the better or worse? What else do immigrants bring to the United States? A hatred of communism? A superiority complex against another ethnic 
group? Drugs? Technological talent? Language, intangible language, is already difficult for people to translate. So how would these sentiments, talents, and products translate into a 
better United States? Things cannot be natural and free-flowing for long, based on my personal experience. Somewhere along the line of joyriding and careless partnerships, a serious 
concern or a grave insult disrupts the merriness. Then matters break off, some go on their way and don't cling on, and others cling on because of their modus operandi. Some people 
stomach a lot more before they become outspoken, others complain and inform about everything, and yet others take vows of silence. I'm not saying there's a direct correlation of these 
atittudes with ethnicity, but I am saying there is a correlation. What is the best out of these three??

I was going to write more to this article on this great and wonderful thing people say is the "A.I. revolution". But I am stopping myself short of going on about the merits of 
A.I. for the simple reason of over-politicization of American social spheres. That is what I think from my perspective. Too many opinions. Too much talk of wealth this, wealth 
that, and fearmongering by those that don't understand the technology. The capability to not have to do manual work for a living, due to A.I., coupled with people's social 
obsessions to make a difference, mean that many people will feel like they have to be part of political movements and make political statements in order to obtain social 
credit. And then they can convert that social credit into cryptocurrency or American dollars or something. I think people still have to work and that people still have the 
right to maintain an autonomy, the right to maintain ownership of their content, and still be required to live as individuals.
